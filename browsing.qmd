## Browsing index

The index is based on De Vriendt et al. 2020the annual biomass increments inside the exclosires. The allometric models are published in the supplementary information in the first paper. The first paper only had the TrÃ¸ndelag sites, and therefore it also was able to combine the annual biomass increment with the canopy cover values to get an even better index. The second paper included the Telemark site, but there has not been calculated any productivity indeces for the Hedmark-Akershus sites.

> **Goal** - To calculate a productivity index for the three regions, using all the years of data.

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).
